Checks the connected SD-card (write / read & compare). 

IMPORTANT NOTE: RUNING THIS APPLICATION WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON YOUR SD-CARD!!!

To start the check, press any DIN-button or MIDI-key.

The application first looks for the first sector that is writeable/readable. 
Then it looks for the last sector readable/writeable. When these boundaries are 
found, it performs a deep check of the R/W sector space, writing nonsense data 
(generated with sector offset) to a sector, read it again and check if the data 
is still the same. the define "check_step" sets the step used for the deep check. 
If you want to check every single sector, set this to 1. Mind that this will 
cause the check to take a very long time. When the check is done, the 
application will report the lower and upper R/W sector, and the number of 
sectors that failed in R/W check.

All messages will be sent to the MIOS-terminal by calling MIOS32_MIDI_SendDebugMessage(..),
and displayed on a connected LCD.

After initialization the application looks for the first writeable sector:
"FS 0x....."

It does this in single sector steps, if max_first_sector is reached, the application
will abort and show the last error. 

Second it looks for the highest writeable sector:
"LS 0x...."

It increments the sector by initial_sector_inc, if one sector fails, it halfs
the incrementer, tries again etc. The last sector is found when the incrementer
is 1 and a R/W fails.

Next the deep check is performed. It starts at the lowest writeable sector,
increments the sector by check_step up to the highest writeable sector. To
check every single sector, change "check_step" to 1. During the check, the
current checked sector, sectors failed the thest and the upper boudary will
be displayed in hexadecimal values:
"0x.... BAD 0x00"
"0x077BFF" (example, my 256MB card)

When the check is done, the lowest/highest writeable sector and failed sectors
will be shown:
"0x00 BAD 0x00"
"0x077BFF"

You can restart the check by pushing any DIN-button or MIDI-key.

I tested this application with a 1GB SanDisk, and a 256MB Pretec card. 

Internals: after each failed read/write operation, the applications inits the
card. Not doing this, causes the communication to fail sometimes, if the app
tried to read/write a sector out of range.
