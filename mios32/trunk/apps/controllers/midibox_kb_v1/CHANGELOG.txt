MIDIbox KB V1.017
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o added possibility to calibrate the delay_slowest values for each individual key of a keyboard.
     New terminal commands:
     - set kb <1|2> key_calibration on: delay values will be measured (method described at the MIDIbox KB webpage)
     - set kb <1|2> key_calibration off: captured delay values will be used: (<measured-delay> * delay_slowest / 1000)
     - set kb <1|2> key_calibration clean: shows the captured measurement values
     - set kb <1|2> key_calibration_value <key> <value>: allows to modify a calibration value directly
     - kb <1|2> delays: shows the measured delay values


MIDIbox KB V1.016
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o Support for AINSER8 module
     It has to be connected to J19; chip select line RC1 will be used (set jumper J4 accordingly)
     In the AIN configuration it can be selected as pin 128..135

   o added 4th AIN pin for "expression pedal" (CC#11 by default can be re-assigned).


MIDIbox KB V1.015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o STM32F4: support for bootloader "enforce_usb_device" flag


MIDIbox KB V1.014
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o added "break_is_make" option which allows to trigger a note when the break
     contact is activated (nice for playing organ style)


MIDIbox KB V1.013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o the MIDI router forwards SysEx messages regardless if channels are filtered,
     or "All" is used. It's ensured that messages are only sent once if multiple
     router nodes forward to the same destination port.

   o added "make_debounced" parameter: Note Off will be played when the
     Break contact has been released, and not when the Make contact has been released.

   o support for MBHP_CORE_STM32F4


MIDIbox KB V1.012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o MIDI router configuration now stored in EEPROM


MIDIbox KB V1.011
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for "ain_bandwidth_ms" which allows to reduce the number of generated events
     over time.

   o added "ain_pitchwheel_inverted", "ain_modwheel_inverted", "ain_sustain_inverted"

   o added "ain_sustain_switch", which allows to change between switch and pot behaviour


MIDIbox KB V1.010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o bugfix for "single_usb" option


MIDIbox KB V1.009
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o support for the "single_usb" option, which can be enabled with the
     bootloader update application V1.012 ("set usb_single 1")

     Use this option if you are working with a Windows PC which can't handle
     the 4 USB ports correctly (e.g. stucking MIDI, Filebrowser operations are failing, etc.)

   o support for Note Off velocity (implemented by Jo aka. Nlate).
     This feature has to be enabled with the release_velocity parameter. In addition, some
     suitable delay values have to be specified, such as:
       set kb 1 release_velocity on
       set kb 1 delay_fastest_release 100
       set kb 1 delay_fastest_release_black_keys 80
       set kb 1 delay_slowest_release 1000


MIDIbox KB V1.008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o dedicated delay value for black keys (delay_fastest_black_keys)
     Will be taken if > 0, otherwise white and black keys take the same delay_fastest value


MIDIbox KB V1.007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o srio_num now stored on EEPROM

   o changed default delay settings (required after performance fix in v1.006)

   o added ain_sustain and ctrl_sustain parameters

   o the min/max values of the potentiometers can now be calibrated with the
       set kb <kb> calibrate <off|pitchwheel|modwheel|sustain>
     command.


MIDIbox KB V1.006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o fix for SRIO scan performance issue


MIDIbox KB V1.005
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   o USB device settings have been changed.
     IMPORTANT: please install MIOS32 Bootloader V1.010 before uploading
     the application! Otherwise code upload via USB won't work anymore!
     (Backup: upload via MIDI IN1/OUT1)

   o 4 USB ports are enabled now.
     Note: if your operating system still displays only a single MIDI port for USB,
     then unplug the USB cable and remove the USB MIDI driver in your system setup,
     so that the driver be installed again once the core module has been re-connected.
     E.g. under MacOS this can be done with the Audio-MIDI Setup application
     (search for "Audio" in Spotlight)

   o support for GM5 driver under Windows.
     - upload the application with MIOS Studio
     - close MIOS Studio
     - install the GM5 driver which can be downloaded from http://www.ucapps.de/mios32_download.html
     - start MIOS Studio -> 4 "GM5" USB ports should be visible


MIDIbox KB V1.000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the initial version with only a subset of planned functions:
  - scans up to two keyboards with optional velocity and individually assignable types
  - supports seven different keyboard types: NoVel8x8, NoVel16x8, NoVel16x16, Vel8x8, Vel16x8, Vel16x16, KorgMicroKontrol
    (list can be easily enhanced in future)
  - 4 USB-MIDI Ports and 4 UART based MIDI IN/OUT
  - integrated MIDI router with 16 nodes
  - integrated MIDI monitor
  - OSC via Ethernet

Next steps:
  - PitchBender connected to J5A.A0
  - Modulation wheel connected to J5A.A1
  - 4 additional pots/faders connected to J5A.A2, J5A.A3, J5B.A4 and J5B.A5
  - MIDI channel, MIDI Port destinations and CC numbers can be configured in MIOS Terminal
  - settings are stored in on-board EEPROM of LPCXPRESSO module
