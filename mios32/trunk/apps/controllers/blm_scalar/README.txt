Required tools:

===============================================================================

Required hardware:
   o one MBHP_CORE_STM32 module
   o a MBHP_BLM_SCALAR system with up to 320 buttons and Duo-Colour -LEDs
   o optional: up to 8 pots or faders

===============================================================================


!! IMPORTANT !! IMPORTANT !! IMPORTANT !! IMPORTANT !! IMPORTANT !!

Since this application supports faders/pots connected to J5,
all unusused analog inputs (J5A.A0..J5B.A7) have to be connected to ground!

If analog inputs are open (neither connected to a fader/pot nor to ground),
random CC events will be generated!

SysEx Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  o F0 00 00 7E 4E <device-id> 00 F7
    Request Layout Informations

    Returns:
    F0 00 00 7E 4E <device-id> 01 <num-rows> <num-columns> <num-colours>
       <num-extra-rows> <num-extra-columns> <num-extra-buttons> F7

  o F0 00 00 7E 4E <device-id> 01 F7
    ignored if received

  o F0 00 00 7E 4E <device-id> 0E F7
    ignored if received

  o F0 00 00 7E 4E <device-id> 0F F7
    Ping: returns F0 00 00 7E 4E <device-id> 0F 00 F7


Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - host requests layout informations with F0 00 00 7E 4E 00 00 F7
   - this application replies with F0 00 00 7E 4E 00 01 ... F7 to send back the
     available number of buttons and LEDs
   - host updates all LEDs by sending CC events (Bn ..)

   - during runtime host updates LEDs that have changed whenever required

   - if the application doesn't receive LED pattern updates within 5 seconds,
     the layout information SysEx string will be sent again.
     This keeps the BLM up-to-date if it temporary has been disconnected from
     the host, and allows to implement an additional timeout mechanism at the 
     host site to check the bidirectional BLM connection.

   - in any case, each 5 seconds a Sysex string will be sent. Either the
     layout info, or a ping.
     The host is allowed to stop sending data if no SysEx strig has been received
     within 15 seconds.


As long as no MIDI data has been received after startup, the BLM is in test mode.
The buttons cycle the colour of the corresponding LED:
   - first button press: green colour
   - second button press: red colour
   - third button press: both colours
   - fourth button press: all LEDs off
   - period
