Created in December 2002 for MIDIbox LC project, which was the very
first MIOS application

The .xpm files are manually created with "xpaint"

The appr. inc files have been converted with convpix_d.pl (located in this directory)

The .asm files are wrappers for relocatable objects, used in
C applications



Integration Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C based Applications (example for glcd_font_big)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

---
include $(MIOS32_PATH)/modules/app_lcd/st7637/app_lcd.mk
---

  2) .c program: add
---
#include <glcd_font.h>
---
     and select font with:
---
  MIOS32_LCD_FontInit(GLCD_FONT_BIG);
---
