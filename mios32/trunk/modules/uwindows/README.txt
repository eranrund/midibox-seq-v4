"UWindows is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) library that enable programmers to create effective user interfaces in few simple and easy steps. User can add buttons, Lebels , edit boxes Determine thier properties (location, size, captions , etc) attach a call back for events (Click, Joystick Press, Timer). In few steps the user will have a GUI form just like windows and IPODs"

It was originally written for the Primer2 and I have ported it to Midibox, there is still much to do but I wanted to show a simple implementation of a GUI for midibox.

It currently REQUIRES a UC1610 based (DOG-G XL) display but I plan to make it more 'compliant' eventually :)

Please contact me on the forum "philetaylor" with any questions and I will try to answer them.

UWindows.pdf contains a full description and api reference.

Please also look at the uwindows example application.
