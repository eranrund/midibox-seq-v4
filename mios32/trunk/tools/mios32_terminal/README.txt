This is the command line version of the MIOS Terminal, which can also be found
in MIOS Studio as very helpful debugging option.

Messages sent with MIOS32_MIDI_SendDebug* are print by the terminal.

In addition, it's also possible to send strings (commands) to the core, which
is forwarded to a callback function which has been installed with 
MIOS32_MIDI_DebugCommandCallback_Init()


The program can be started with:
   mios32_terminal [--device_id <sysex-device-id>]

E.g.:
   mios32_terminal
or:
   mios32_terminal --device_id 1 (MacOS only)


Currently only a makefile for MacOS/Windows is provided, but it shouldn't be so
difficult to adapt it for other operating systems.

Required Libraries (MacOS):
   - MacOS Core Framework
   - libportmidi (-> see $MIOS32_PATH/drivers/gnustep/portmidi/pm_mac/README_MAC.txt)

Some MIOS32 files are used as well (although this app doesn't run on a 
microcontroller). They are taken from $MIOS32_PATH

===============================================================================

Compiling under Windows
This is tested under Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0 Express Edition.

First you must create portmidi.lib and porttime.lib. from $MIOS32_PATH/drivers/gnustep/portmidi
directory open the portmidi (or portmidi-vc9) .sln file and build portmidi and porttime. 

You will need to check that VSINSTALLDIR/VCINSTALLDIR are correct in make.bat. 
It is a simple batch file which should set the rest of the environment. Then type

make /f makefile.win
